CS-255-T5581 System Analysis and Design 22EW5 Portfolio Prep

Prompt
For this course, you will be submitting one portion of each project into the GitHub repository for your portfolio. From Project One, submit the business requirements document. From Project Two, submit the system design document. Together, these documents showcase your work in system analysis and design. These documents demonstrate your ability to collect requirements from the customer and design a system that meets those needs.

You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting is a valuable skill to cement your learning. It also will help add context to refresh your memory when you use your portfolio in the future. Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was the owner of DriverPass, an application to help prepare prospective drivers pass their exam and road test on the first attempt. They wanted the app to be designed for customers to log in, choose and purchase a package that included road time with a driving instructor, as well as access to online studying materials and important news regarding updates with the DMV.

What did you do particularly well?

I excelled at making sure the client received every feature they envisioned and making sure they knew the options for future use and how to scale up when needed.
They expressed not wanting to have to maintain back ups or security, so I made sure they knew their options for having a service included that did this for them.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would improve on my sequence diagram, which did not at all have the level of detail that I wanted. I would ensure more thorough details to make sure all the information existed to display what the application does. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs are very important, only second to the vision that the owner wants for the application. If you do not consider the user's needs, then the product will fail. If they have a hard time gaining access, or the application does not benefit the user, they will not use it. It must be a forethought in the design to always have the user begin and end with a great experience. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach design with the client's vision first. I want to know their goals, what problem they are solving, what level of responsibility they want in maintenance and how their product can live a long and successful life. To analyze and design, I ask myself what does the client see, what does the user see, and how they want it to flow. I will ask myself what can go wrong with this? Is anything missing? What problems will users eventually run into when operating the products? Knowing and planning for all of these issues will prevent most from ever coming to fruition.
